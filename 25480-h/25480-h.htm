<span class="i0">This caus'd the king, suddenly, to laugh most heartily,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till the tears trickled fast down from his eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to their supper were they set orderly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With hot bag-puddings and good apple-pies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nappy ale, good and stale, in a brown bowl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which did about the board merrily trowl.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">For my welcome in every good degree:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Here's dainty lightfoot! In faith, said the king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never before eat so dainty a thing.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">We never pay penny for it, by my fay:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now and then we make bold with our king's deer.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then I think, said our king, that it is venison.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each fool, quoth Richard, full well may know that:<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And to their beds they passed presently.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last, at the miller's cot, soon they espy'd him out,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As he was mounting upon his fair steed;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Which made the miller's heart wofully bleed;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Doubting the king would cut off his head.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And with his nobles at Westminster lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recounting the sports and pastimes they had taken,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In this late progress along on the way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of them all, great and small, he did protest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The miller of Mansfield's sport lik&egrave;d him best.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And now, my lords, quoth the king, I am determined<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Against St. George's next sumptuous feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That this old miller, our new confirmed knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With his son Richard, shall here be my guest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, in this merriment, 'tis my desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To talk with the jolly knight, and the young squire.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When as the noble lords saw the king's pleasantness,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They were right joyful and glad in their hearts:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pursuivant there was sent straight on the business,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The which had oftentimes been in those parts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he came to the place, where they did dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His message orderly then 'gan he tell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">God save your worship, then said the messenger,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And grant your lady her own heart's desire;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And to your son Richard good fortune and happiness;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That sweet, gentle, and gallant young squire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our king greets you well, and thus he doth say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You must come to the court on St. George's day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Therefore, in any case, fail not to be in place.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I wis, quoth the miller, this is an odd jest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What should we do there? faith, I am half afraid.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I doubt, quoth Richard, to be hang'd at the least.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, quoth the messenger, you do mistake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our king he provides a great feast for your sake.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then said the miller, By my troth, messenger,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou hast contented my worship full well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold, here are three farthings, to quite thy gentleness,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For these happy tidings which thou dost tell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me see, hear thou me; tell to our king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll wait on his mastership in everything.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The pursuivant smiled at their simplicity,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, making many legs, took the reward;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his leave taking with great humility<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the king's court again he repaired;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showing unto his grace, merry and free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The knight's most liberal gift and bounty.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When he was gone away, thus 'gan the miller say,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here come expenses and charges indeed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now must we needs be brave, tho' we spend all we have;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For of new garments we have great need:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of horses and serving-men we must have store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bridles and saddles, and twenty things more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tush, sir John, quo' his wife, why should you fret, or frown?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You shall ne'er be at no charges for me;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">With everything else as fine as may be;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And on our mill-horses swift we will ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pillows and pannels, as we shall provide.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In this most stately sort, rode they unto the court,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their jolly son Richard rode foremost of all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who set up, for good hap,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> a cock's feather in his cap,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And so they jetted<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> down to the king's hall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The merry old miller with hands on his side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wife, like maid Marian, did mince at that tide.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The king and his nobles that heard of their coming,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Meeting this gallant knight with his brave train;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Welcome, sir knight, quoth he, with your gay lady:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Good sir John Cockle, once welcome again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so is the squire of courage so free.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span><span class="i0">The king and his courtiers laugh at this heartily,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While the king taketh them both by the hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the court-dames and maids, like to the queen of spades,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The miller's wife did so orderly stand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A milk-maid's courtesy at every word;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down all the folks were set to the board.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There the king royally, in princely majesty,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sate at his dinner with joy and delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they had eaten well, then he to jesting fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And in a bowl of wine drank to the knight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here's to you both, in wine, ale, and beer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thanking you heartily for my good cheer.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth sir John Cockle, I'll pledge you a pottle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were it the best ale in Nottinghamshire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then, said our king, now I think of a thing;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some of your lightfoot I would we had here.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Ho! ho! quoth Richard, full well I may say it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis knavery to eat it, and then to betray it.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why art thou angry? quoth our king merrily;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In faith I take it now very unkind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought thou wouldst pledge me in ale and wine heartily.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Quoth Dick, You are like to stay till I have din'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You feed us with twatling dishes so small;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Zounds, a black-pudding is better than all.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus in great merriment was the time wholly spent;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And then the ladies prepar&egrave;d to dance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Sir John Cockle, and Richard, incontinent<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unto their places the king did advance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here with the ladies such sport they did make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nobles with laughing did make their sides ache.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Many thanks for their pains did the king give them,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Asking young Richard then, if he would wed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among these ladies free, tell me which liketh thee?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Quoth he, Jugg Grumball, Sir, with the red head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She's my love, she's my life, her will I wed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She hath sworn I shall have her wedding bed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then sir John Cockle the king called unto him,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And of merry Sherwood made him o'erseer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave him out of hand three hundred pound yearly:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Take heed now you steal no more of my deer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once a quarter let's here have your view;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, sir John Cockle, I bid you adieu.<br /></span>
